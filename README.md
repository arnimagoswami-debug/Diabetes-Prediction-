# 🏥 Diabetes Prediction System

An **AI-powered Machine Learning web application** built using **Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit** to predict the risk of diabetes based on patient health parameters.

This project is ideal for **Data Analyst, Data Science, and Machine Learning portfolios**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Diabetes Prediction System analyzes medical and demographic data to determine whether a person is **Diabetic or Non-Diabetic**.  
It uses a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model trained on the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset** and presents predictions through an interactive and user-friendly Streamlit interface.

The application focuses on:
- Risk-based prediction
- Probability interpretation
- Health risk factor analysis
- Clean and intuitive UI design
